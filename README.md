# 1.5. Java Utils (Level 1 - Exercise 2)

## Project Description üìÑ

This Java project solves the following exercise:

"Add to the class from the previous exercise, the functionality to list a directory tree with the contents of all its levels (recursively) so that they are printed on the screen in alphabetical order within each level, indicating in addition whether it is a directory (D) or a file (F), and its last modification date".

The goal is to gain experience with **recursive algorithms, file system traversal, and handling and displaying file metadata**, which are essential skills in many applications, especially those dealing with file management, backups, or data processing. Additionally, it helps to refine the understanding of Java I/O and collections for organizing and presenting hierarchical data.
